* Chapter 1
- program counter specifies location of next instruction to execute
- each thread requires one program counter
  
- cache coherency :: in multiprocessor environments all CPUs must have the most recent value in their cache
- spooling :: the overlapping of output of one job with input of another
* Chapter 2
communications
- message passing model
  - create and delete communication connections
  - send and receives messages across these connections to specified host name or proess name
  - i.e. from client to server
- shared-memory model
  - create and gain access to memory regions
* Chapter 3
Process is divided into multiple parts
- text section :: program code
- data section :: containing global variables
- heap :: containing memory dynamically allocated during running time
- stack :: containing temporary data

** PCB
Process Control Block :: contains information associated with each process
most relevantly it contains
- process state
- program counter
- cpu registers
additionally it contains
- cpu scheduling information
- memory management information
- accounting information
- i/o status information
 
- information must be stored and reloaded from pcb to allow cpu to switch from process to process
- this process is called a context switch
** Threads
- like a portion of a process
- requires its own program counter
** Process Scheduling
Maintains scheduling queues of processes:
- job queue :: set of all processes in the system
- ready queue 
- device queues :: set of processes waiting for an i/o device

Short-term scheduler or CPU scheduler :: selects which process should be executed next and allocates cpu 
- since it is invoked frequently in must be fast
Long-term scheduler or job scheduler :: selects which processes should be brought into the ready queue
- controls the degree of multiprogramming
Processes can be:
- i/o-bound process
- cpu-bound process
- the long-term scheduler strives for good process mix
Medium-term scheduler :: remove process from memory to store on disk and bring back to memory
- can be added if degree of multiprogramming needs to be decreased
