* paper thoughts
- start with survey of blockchain
  - talk about its flexibility and how it can be parameterized to fit needs
- move to finances: focus on areas with blockchain application
  - online transactions

- survey of blockchain technology and its applications
- includes sections about financial industry

solves two problems of currency based transaction:
- double spend problem
- byzantine generals problem

four types of blockchain:
- permissionless
- permissioned
- public
- private

- buterin blogpost on public vs private blockchain:  https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/07/on-public-and-private-blockchains/
nonpublic blockchains broken into two types:
 - consortium blockchains
   - preferrable when several organizations have common goals and 
     wish to share cost, data
 - fully-private blockchains

- paper goes through configuration of blockchain vs needs https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7930224/?part=1

3.1 public blockchains
- there is typically significant savings in terms of transaction cost 
- but proof of work is wasteful in terms of computing power

3.2 private blockchains
- consortium blockchain has limited trusted members mandatorily sign off on transactions
- offers flexibility due to increased control over rules of transaction
- easier to gain overall consensus to change rules of transaction
- increase accountability as all nodes are named
- limited network delays reduce transaction commit time (small difference?)

4. blockchain protocols
- how a blockchain implements its consensus mechanism determines the strength of the network
- goes into some technical details about consensus algorithms and etc https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/Workshops-and-Seminars/201703/Documents/Christian%20Cachin%20blockchain-itu.pdf
 
4.1 proof of work

4.2 proof of stake
- variation called delegated proof of stake
  - think representative democracy instead of direct democracy
  - stakeholders elect delegates to generate and validate a block
  - implemented by bitshares
 
4.3 practical byzantine fault tolerance
- an approach to deal with byzantine generals problem is Federate Byzantine Agreement (FBA)
  - need to find better description of solution
- practical byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) is a replication algorithm which utilizes FBA
- used by hyperledger as consensus algorithm
- *description of this strategy is in text*
- it has been seen that PBFT maps well to blanks, supply chain, payroll systems
 
- lists several projects that apply blockchains, also risks, disregard first half of paper http://scet.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/AIR-2016-Blockchain.pdf

5.3 private data storage
