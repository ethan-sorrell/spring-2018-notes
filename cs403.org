* Scheme Summary
** notes
- always think of lists in terms of their implementation as singly-linked list
- foldl and foldr are noteworthy
- look at optimized fib function
- try optimizing our combinations function similarly
** keywords
- define, load
- +, -, *, quotient, modulo
- =, <, >, <=, >=
- and, or, not
- if, cond
- car, cdr
- null?, integer?, symbol?, boolean?, procedure?, eq?, equal?
- length, append, reverse
- list, flatten, map, fold_left (foldl), fold_right (foldr), filter, zip, zipwith
- let, let*, letrec

** concepts
- lambda
- variadic functions
* Scheme
- call function :: (functionname params)
- define function :: (define (functionname params) body)
- our naive fib function :: cs403/ex1.scm
- load function definitions :: (load "filename")
- our optimized fib function :: cs403/ex2.scm
- representing list :: '(a b c d e f g)
  - lists are implemented as singly linked lists
- a few useful list functions
  - (car List) :: returns the first element in the list
  - (cdr List) :: returns all but the first element in the list
  - (cadr List) :: returns the car of the cdr i.e. second element in the list
  - (cadddr List) :: returns the car of the cdr of the cdr of the cdr
- our length function :: cs403/ex3.scm
- our summation function :: cs403/ex4.scm
  - note that in a multiplication function the base-case becomes 1
- some type checking
  - (pair? x) :: returns true for anything constructed with cons
  - (rational? x)
  - (integer? x)
  - (number? x) :: returns true if x is integer or rational
  - (boolean? x)
  - (null? x)
  - (procedure? x) :: returns true if x is a function
  - (eq? x y) :: returns true if x and y are the same (works on any type)
    - there's actually more nuance than that though
    - = compares value, for instance equivalent fractions
    - eq? checks if objects are the same
  - (equal? List1 List2) :: returns true if the provided lists contain the same elements
    - our own implementation of equal? :: cs403/ex8.scm
- a new list function
  - (cons element List) :: adds element to the front of List
- our bubble sort implementation :: cs403/ex5.scm
- our append implementation :: cs403/ex6.scm
- our reverse implementation :: cs403/ex7.scm
more list functions
- (list Element) :: equivalent to (cons Element '())
- (flatten List) :: returns list with all nesting removed (not predefined)
  - our flatten implementation :: cs403/ex9.scm
- (map Procedure List) :: performs Procedure on every element in List and returns a new list of equal size
  - our map implementation :: cs403/ex10.scm
- (filter Predicate List) :: applies predicate to elements in List and removes those that return false
  - our filter implementation :: cs403/ex11.scm
- (fold-left Procedure Elemeent List) :: combines all elements in List using Procedure moving from left to right (left associative) beginning with Element
  - our fold-left implementation :: cs403/ex12.scm
  - what would (fold-left cons '() '(a b c d)) return?
- (fold-right Procedure Element List) :: combines all elements in List using Procedure moving from right to left (right associative) beginning with Element
  - our fold-right implementation :: cs403/ex12.scm
  - what about (fold-right cons '() '(a b c d)) return?
  - what about swapcons
  - what about list
- (zip List1 List2) :: creates a list of pairs from elements of List1 and List2
  - our zip implementation :: cs403/ex13.scm
- (zipwith Procedure List1 List2) :: creates a list by combining pairs of elements from List1 and List2 using Procedure
  - our zipwith implementation :: cs403/ex13.scm
Tree Traversals       
- our tree defined as data :; cs403/ex14.scm
- our postorder implementation :: cs403/ex14.scm
Lambda Functions
- (lambda (Params) (Expression)) :: returns a Procedure that takes Params and evaluates to Expression
  - our anonymous cube function :: cs403/ex15.scm
  - our anonymous reverse function :: cs403/ex15.scm
  - note that all functions are actually implicitly created as lambda functions that may then be assigned to symbols
Let
- (let List Expr) :: List contains pairs of Symbols and Values, Expr is evaluated substituting Symbols with there corresponding values
  - our example let expression :: cs403/ex16.scm
  - List is "evaluated" in parallel drawing from global scope
- (let* List Expr)
  - List is "evaluated" sequentially
- (letrec List Expr)
