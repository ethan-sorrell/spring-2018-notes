* Chapter 1
- program counter specifies location of next instruction to execute
- each thread requires one program counter
  
- cache coherency :: in multiprocessor environments all CPUs must have the most recent value in their cache
- spooling :: the overlapping of output of one job with input of another
* Chapter 2
Operating System Services:
- User Interface
- Program execution

- protection and security
Types of System Calls:
- Process Control
- File management
- Device management
- information maintenance

  - message passing model
    - create and delete communication connections
    - send and receives messages across these connections to specified host name or proess name
    - i.e. from client to server
  - shared-memory model
    - create and gain access to memory regions
- Protection
* Chapter 3
Process is divided into multiple parts
- text section :: program code
- data section :: containing global variables
- heap :: containing memory dynamically allocated during running time
- stack :: containing temporary data

** PCB
Process Control Block :: contains information associated with each process
most relevantly it contains
  - process state
  - program counter
  - cpu registers
additionally it contains
  - cpu scheduling information
  - memory management information
  - accounting information
  - i/o status information
 
- information must be stored and reloaded from pcb to allow cpu to switch from process to process
- this process is called a *context switch*
** Threads
- like a portion of a process
- requires its own program counter
** Process Scheduling
Maintains scheduling queues of processes:
  - job queue :: set of all processes in the system
  - ready queue 
  - device queues :: set of processes waiting for an i/o device
- Short-term scheduler or CPU scheduler :: selects which process should be executed next and allocates cpu 
  - since it is invoked frequently in must be fast
- Long-term scheduler or job scheduler :: selects which processes should be brought into the ready queue
  - controls the degree of multiprogramming
Processes can be:
  - i/o-bound process
  - cpu-bound process
  - the long-term scheduler strives for good process mix
- Medium-term scheduler :: remove process from memory to store on disk and bring back to memory
  - can be added if degree of multiprogramming needs to be decreased
** Process Creation
- process tree created by parent processes creating child processes
- child processes can have variable amount of dependence on parent process regarding:
  - execution
  - resource sharing
- child process has its own address space with a copy of the parent's image
** Process Termination
Execution ends normally followed by exit() system call:
- Resources de-allocated
- Returns status flag from child to parent
- PCB remains
Execution terminated by abort() system call:
- cascading termination of children's children
- parent may wait for termination of child process with wait()
  - pid = wait(&status)
- zombie process :: process waiting for parent to call wait()
- orphan :: parent terminated without calling wait()
  - init will take over and call wait()
** Inter-process Communication
- Independent process :: cannot affect or be affected by execution of another process
- Cooperating process :: can affect or be affected by execution of another process
- reasons for cooperating processes:
  - information sharing
  - computation speedup
  - modularity
  - convenience
- There are two models of IPC 
  - message passing
    - 
  - shared memory
*** Producer-Consumer Problem
- paradigm for cooperating processes
- exchange information via buffer
  - may be bounded or unbounded
*** Shared Memory
- tends to be the faster solution
- communication is under control of the user processes not the operating system
- major issue of allowing user processes to synchronize their actions on shared memory
  - e.g. not allowing both processes to write to the same address
*** Message Passing
- slower because of overhead of system calls
- easier to implement
- ideal for smaller amounts of data
- many choices to be made in specific implementation details (see textbook)
**** Synchronization
- Message passing may be either *blocking* or *non-blocking*
  - blocking (synchronous)
    - blocking send :: sender is blocked until message received
    - blocking receive :: receiver is blocked until message available
  - non-blocking (asynchronous)
    - non-blocking send :: sender sends message and continues
    - non-blocking receive :: receives gets either valid message or null message
**** Direct Communication
- connection established between exactly two processes
**** Indirect Communication
- messages are directed and received from "mailboxes" (aka ports)
- each mailbox has a unique ideal
- mailbox must be shared
- problems arise when mailbox shared with more than two processes
**** Buffering
- zero capacity :: no messages are queued on a link
  - sender always waits for receiver (*rendezvous*)
- bounded capacity :: finite length of n messages
  - sender only waits if link full
- unbounded capacity :: infinite length
  - sender never waits
*** Examples - Windows
- windows is message passing centric via *advanced local procedure call
- connection ports and communication ports are created to allows processes to communicate
- different message-passing techniques are used depending on the size of the message
  - smaller messages use a message queue
  - large messages passed through shared memory called a *section object*
  - larger messages that can not fit in the section object use an API call that allows server to write directly to the address space of the client
** Communication in client-server systems
*** Sockets
- socket :: an endpoint for communication
- combination of an ip address and port
- ports below 1024 are well known, for standard services
- two types of sockets:
  - connection-oriented (TCP)
  - connectionless (UDP)
*** Remote Procedure Calls
- sockets are a relatively low level method of communication between processes
- Client invokes a procedure on a remote host as if it were a local procedure
  - ports still used for service differentiation
  - but packets are not used
- stubs :: client-side proxy for the actual process on server
- client-side stub locates the server and *marshals* the parameters
  - to resolve differences between the systems (e.g. client little-endian and server big-endian)
  - XDR is used :: external data representation
- server-side stub receives, unpacks the marshaled parameters and performs procedure
Handling failure
- the at most once semantic is generally used, but the exactly once semantic may be used here
- the server can use at most once, but also send an ACK once the call has been executed
- the client uses exactly once, and continues sending the call until an ACK is received
Establishing Connection
- OS typically provides a rendezvous or *matchmaker* daemon to connect client and server
- alternatively a fixed-point address may be used
* Chapter 4
- thread :: a basic unit of cpu utilization
  - composed of :
    - thread ID
    - program counter
    - a register set
    - a stack
  - additionally multiple threads share:
    - a code section
    - a data section
    - and other OS resources
- When are threads useful?
  - when an application has multiple tasks which may need to wait for I/O
  - e.g. an application may implement threads for:
    - updating display
    - fetching data
    - spell checking
    - answering a network request
- why not just create new processes?
  - this incurs additional overhead which is unnecessary in many cases
- Benefits of multi-threading can be broken into four categories
  - responsiveness
  - resource sharing
  - economy :: reduced overhead vs process creation
  - scalability :: a single thread can run on only a single core
** multi-core programming
- parallelism :: ability for a system to perform more than one task simultaneously
  - i.e. multiple tasks are running at the same time
- concurrency :: ability for a system to allow more than one task to make progress
  - i.e. multiple tasks are running in the same window of time
- types of parallelism 
  - data parallelism :: distributes subsets of the same data across multiple cores, each running a portion of the same operation
  - task parallelism :: distributes threads across cores, each thread performing unique operation
- user threads :: management done by user-level thread library
- kernel threads :: managed by the kernel
*** Multi-threading models
- many-to-one model
  - many user-level threads mapped to a single kernel thread
  - entire process can be blocked by a single blocking system call
- one-to-one model
  - creating a user-level thread creates a kernel thread
  - drawback is the overhead of creating kernel threads
  - have to be careful about creating too many user-threads 
- many-to-many model
  - allows many user levels threads to be mapped to many kernel threads
  - allows for creation of many user-threads without worry and supports concurrency
*** Explicit Threading (using Thread Library)
- two primary ways of implementing:
  - library entirely in user space
  - kernel library entirely in OS
- pthreads :: posix standard API for thread creation and synchronization
  - all follow the same specification not necessarily the same implementation
*** Implicit Threading
- creation and management of threads done by compiler rather than programmer
- three methods explored:
  - Thread Pools
    - create a number of threads in a pool where they wait for use
    - slightly faster than creating a new thread
    - can limit number of threads by setting pool size
  - OpenMP
  - Grand Central Dispatch
** Threading Issues
- fork() and exec()
- does fork() duplicate only the calling thread or all threads
  - some UNIXes have two versions of fork
- exec() usually works by replacing the running process including all threads
** Signal Handling
1. signal is generated by particular event
2. signal is delivered to a process
3. signal must be handled by either a default or user-defined signal handler (which overrides default)

- synchronous signal :: generated by/delivered to the same running process
- asynchronous signal :: generated by an external event delivered to another process
- for single threaded process, signal delivery is straightforward
- for multi-threaded processes the question of which threads to deliver signal to arises
** Thread Cancellation
- target thread :: thread to be cancelled
- two general approaches:
  - asynchronous cancellation :: terminates the target thread immediately
  - deferred cancellation :: allows target thread to periodically check if it should be cancelled
    - termination occurs when a cancellation point is reached
    - then a cleanup handler is invoked
- Thread-local storage :: allows each thread to have its own copy of data
** Lightweight Process
- lightweight process :: allow communication between kernel and thread library
  - each LWP is attached to a single kernel thread
  - more like an intermediate data structure than a process
- application schedules user threads to available LWP instead of kernel threads
- scheduler activation provided upcalls - communication from kernel to upcall handler in thread library
  - e.g. kernel informs a thread will be blocked, and allocate a new LWP
  - then application can schedule another thread to the new LWP
* Chapter 5 - Synchronization
** Background
- processes can execute concurrently which can cause data inconsistency problems
- if both processes modify the same value, *race condition* problems may arise
** Critical-Section Problem
- consider a system of n processes
  - each process has a critical section such that only one process may be in critical section concurrently
    - otherwise data discrepancy may arise
- solution :: each section must ask permission to enter critical section
  - entry section :: where permission is requested
  - critical section
  - exit section
  - remainder section :: optional
- two approaches to critical-section handling:
  - preemptive :: a process in kernel mode could be preempted by another process
    - more responsive
    - don't have to worry about a program taking too long
  - non-preemptive :: a process in kernel mode can not be preempted by another processes
    - free from race conditions
    - only one process may be in kernel mode at a time
*** SOLUTION REQUIREMENTS:
  - mutual exclusion :: only one process may be in its critical section at a time
  - progress :: if no process is in its critical section, we must eventually select the next process to enter critical section
  - bounded waiting :: there must be some bound on how many items may enter their critical section after a process has requested to enter its critical section
** Peterson's Solution
- software solution to CSP
  - not guaranteed to work on modern architecture
** Synchronization Hardware      
- see problems 5.8 and 5.9
- locking :: protecting critical regions through the use of locks
- atomic :: non-interruptible unit
- for multiprocessor systems, it is inefficient to disable interrupts on all processors
  - instead we use atomic instructions:
    - test_and_set()
    - compare_and_swap()
  - see textbook, works through implementations that satisfy CSP requirements
** Mutex Locks
- previous solutions are quite complicated
- mutex is a much simpler solution
  - boolean variable indicates if lock is available or not
  - acquire() and release() system calls
  - calls to acquire and release must be atomic
- problem with this solution: it introduces busy waiting
  - busy waiting :: while a process is in its critical section, any other process attempting to enter critical section stuck on acquire()
  - called a spinlock
** Semaphore
- may be used to solve various synchronization problems
- an integer variable that can only be accessed through two standard atomic functions:
  - wait() :: waits while S is 0 then decrements and finishes after
  - signal() :: increments S
- if S is a binary value, then we have a mutex lock
- if S is an integer value, then we have a *Counting Semaphore*
*** Problems
- deadlock :: multiple processes waiting indefinitely for an event that can be caused by on the waiting processes
- starvation :: indefinite blocking 
  - e.g. if we use a stack to feed our implementation
- priority inversion ::
*** Bounded-Buffer Problem
- semaphore mutex init to 0
- semaphore full init to 0 :: number of buffers containing an item
- semaphore empty init to n :: number of empty buffers
*** Readers-Writers Problem
- Problem:
  - allow multiple readers simultaneously
  - only one singer writer can access the shared data at the same time
- Variations:
  - no readers kept waiting unless writer has permission to use shared object
  - once writer is ready, it performs the write ASAP
Both variations have possible starvation problems that must be addressed

- rw_mutex :: semaphore initialized to 1
- mutex :: semaphore initialized to 1
- read_count :: integer initialized to 0

- mutex ensures mutual exclusion semaphore when read_count is update
- read_count keeps track of how many processes are currently reading
- rw_mutex functions as a mutual exclusion semaphore for writers
*** Dining-Philosophers Problem
- Problem:
  - philosophers alternate eating and thinking
  - to eat the philosopher needs two chopsticks
  - they each share one chopstick with their left neighbor and one with their right neighbor
  - they can only try to pick up one chopstick at a time
- see textbook for more
** Monitors
- a high-level abstraction that helps with process synchronization
- we have conditional variables and queues for processes waiting to enter critical section
** Semaphore implementation with no busy waiting  
- two operations
  - block :: place the process invoking the operation on the appropriate waiting queue
  - wakeup :: remove one of processes in the waiting queue and place in ready queue
basically wait() and signal() end up being calls to block() and wakeup() respectively
** Monitor implementation using semaphores
- semaphore mutex
- semaphore next
- int next_count
* Chapter 7
** System Model
- each process utilizes a resource as follows:
  - request
  - use
  - release
** Deadlock characterization
- mutual exclusion :: only one process can use a resource ata time
- hold and wait :: a process holding a resource is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other processors
- no preemption :: a resource can be released only voluntarily by the process holding it
- circular wait :: there's a set of resource in which a waits on b that waits on c that waits on d that waits on a
** Resource-allocation graph 
- V is partitioned into two types
  - P :: processes
  - R :: resources
- E is partitioned into two types
  - request edge :: directed edge P -> R
  - assignment edge :: directed edge R -> P
* Chapter 6
- successful scheduling involves utilizing downtime from things like blocking system calls
- cpu burst :: time allocated to cpu
- cpu burst :: time allocated to i/o
 
- short-term scheduler :: selects process in ready queue and allocates CPU
- preemptive / non-preemptive
 
  - dispatcher module :: gives control of cpu to process selected by short-term scheduler
  - *dispatch latency* :: time taken to stop one process and start another
** scheduling criteria
- cpu utilization
- throughput :: number of processes that complete their execution per time unit
- turnaround time :: amount of time to execute a particular processors (from arrival to finish)
- waiting time (in ready queue)
- response time (from request to first response)
** FCFS scheduling
- convoy effect :: short processes waiting for long processes
** SJF scheduling
- if we know the length of the next CPU burst for each process, SJF is optimal
- the problem is that we usually will not know the length of next CPU burst
- we can also create a preemptive variant : shortest remaining time first
- exponential average :: a technique for prediction next CPU burst duration:
    t_n = actual length of nth cpu burst
    tau_n+1 = predicted value for n+1th cpu burst
    alpha, 0 <= alpha <= 1
    define: tau_n+1 = alpha*t_n + (1-alpha) * tau_n
** Priority Scheduling
- a priority number is associated with each process
  - smallest int is highest priority
- CPU is allocated to process with the highest priority
- problem - *starvation* :: low priority processes may never execute
- solution - *aging* :: increase priority with time
** Round Robin
- Each process gets a small unit of CPU time (*time quantum* q)
- Timer interrupts after every quantum to schedule next process
*** round robin performance
- No process waits more than (n-1) * q time
- if q is large :: we essentially have FIFO
- if q is small :: q must be large w.r.t context switch or overhead will be high
- heuristic : 80% of cpu bursts should be shorter than q
** Multilevel Queue
- ready queue could be partitioned into separate queues e.g.
  - foreground (interactive)
  - background (batch)
- process permanently assigned to one of these queues
** Multilevel feedback queue
- multilevel feedback queue :: can go from one queue to another based on certain criteria
- each queue has its own scheduling algorithm:
  - foreground uses RR
  - background uses FCFS
- scheduling must be done between the queues
  - Fixed priority scheduling :: e.g. one queue always has priority (has possibility of starvation)
  - time slice :: each queue gets a certain amount of CPU time
- in another implementation we could move processes between queues
  - this is one way that we could implement aging
** Algorithmic Evaluation 
- analytic evaluation
  - deterministic modeling
  - queueing models
- simulation
- implementation
*** Deterministic Modeling
- type of analytic evaluation
- takes a particular predetermined workload and determines the performance of different algorithms
*** Queueing Models
- input is determined probabilistic-ally
  - e.g. arrival of processes, cpu burst, and i/o burst
  - most of these things follow exponential distribution
*** Simulation
- programmed model of computer system
- clock is a variable
- gather statistics indicating algorithm performance
- instead of using probabilistic-driven input we can use a trace tape
- trace tape :: input recorded from actual system that can be fed into simulation
*** Implementation
- implementing a new scheduler and testing in real systems is expensive and risky
- most flexible schedulers can be modified per-system
  - or provide APIs to modify priorities
  - but environments vary
** Thread Scheduling
- process-contention scope :: scheduling done within a process between threads
- system-contention scope :: scheduling done between all threads in a system
** Windows Scheduling
- 32-level priority scheme (higher number is higher priority)
- 1-15 for variable classes, 16-31 for real-time classes
- priority 0 for memory-management thread
- queue for each priority
- runs idle thread if no other run-able threads are available

- within each priority class there are 7 possible relative priority

** Dispatcher Shell
* Chapter 8
- CPU can only access main memory and registers
- Register access takes one clock, but main memory can take longer, *stall*
- *Cache* sits between register and main memory
** Base and Limit Registers
- a pair of addresses that define the beginning and size of a partition in memory
** Address Binding
- input queue :: bring program to disk for execution
- compile time :: bind symbolic addresses in source code to relocatable addresses
- load time :: bind relocatable addresses to physical addresses
- execution time :: bind dynamically loaded system libraries (*dynamic linking*)
- *Logical Addresses vs Physical Address*
** Memory-Management Unit
- Base register becomes relocation register
- 
** Dynamic Loading 
- Routine is not loading until it is called
- All routines kept on disk in relocatable load format
** Dynamic Linking 
- static linking :: system libraries and program code
- dynamic linking :: linking postponed until execution time
  - particularly useful for libraries
  - small piece of code called *stub* used to locate appropriate routine
  - also called *shared libraries*
** Swapping
- backing store :: hold copies of all memory images for all users
  - ready queue holds ready to run processes including those in backing store
  - unstructured data, allows for faster use than normal filesystem
- roll out, roll in :: variant of swapping used for priority based scheduling
  - lower-priority process swapped out for higher-priority process
** MISSING NOTES!
** Dynamic Storage-Allocation Problem
** Fragmentation
** Segmentation
** Paging
- divide physical memory into fixed-sized blocks called *frames*
- divide logical memory into same-sized blocks called *pages*
- *page table* allows translate logical to physical addresses
  - page table located in pcb
- paging eliminates external fragmentation
- internal fragmentation:
  - (space required) % (page size) = internal fragmentation for a particular process
- this implies that small page size is preferred, however each page requires some overhead,
so we will not want our pages to be too small.
- for one, our page table must grow with number of pages
- Typical size today is ~4K
*** Free frames
- operating system must store information about which frames are allocated/availalbe
- this information is stored in a data structure called a *frame table*
*** Implementation of Page Table 
- page table kept in main memory
- PTBR :: page-table base register
  - points to the page table
- PTLR :: page-table length register
  - indicates size of the page table
- when using page tables, every data/instruction access requires two memory accesses
  - one to find physical address from page table
  - another to access physical address
- how can we deal with this?
  - register to hold page table
  - use of special, fast hardware cache called *associate memory*
also known as *translation look-aside buffer* / *TLB*
**** Associative memory
- when we perform a page look up, we can load into TLB
  - this is called a *TLB miss* when we don't already have TLB entry
- next time we perform that page lookup, we can lookup from TLB, *TLB hit*
- TLB is typically small
  - replacement policies must be considered, 
  - some entries can be *wired down* for permanent fast access
  *Effective Access Time*
- associate lookup time: \epsilon time units
- memory access time: t time units
- hit ratio: \alpha
    Effective Access Time (EAT) =
      (1 * t + \epsilon) * \alpha + (2 * t + \epsilon)*(1 - \alpha)
**** Address-Space Protection
- some TLBs store *address-space identifier (ASID)* in each TLB entry,
- uniquely identifies each process to provide address-space protection
  - Not matching ASID is a TLB miss
  - allows for multiple processors
  - otherwise TLB would need to be flushed on every context switch
*** Memory Protections via Page Table
- valid-invalid bit attached to each entry in page table:
  - valid :: page is in process logical address space
  - invalid :: page not in process' logical address space
  - or use page-table length register
*** Shared Pages
shared code 
- one copy of read-only (*reentrant*) code shared among processess
private code and data
- each process keeps a separate copy of this
** Structure of Page Table
- For a 32-bit logical address space and 4KB page size, 
  - page table takes 4 MB
- How do we allocate this memory?
  - *hierarchical page table*
  - *hashed page table*
  - *inverted page table*
- A hierarchical page table with many pages is also known as
   *forward mapping page table*
*** Hashed Page Tables 
- common in address spaces greater than 32 bits
- virtual page number is hashed into a page table
- collisions are dealt with by chaining
- A variation for this scheme has been proposed called *clustered page tables*
  - similar to hashed page tables except:
  - each bucket refers to several pages instead of just 1
*** Inverted Page Table
- create a page table based on pid that translates to a physical address
* Chapter 9
- program needs to be in memory to execute, but entire program not needed at same time
- so why don't we partially-load programs?
- would mean programs aren't limited by physical memory constraint
- virtual memory :: separation of user logical memory from physical memory
- virtual address space :: logical view of how process is stored in memory
virtual memory can be implemented by:
  - demand paging
  - demand segmentation
- sparse address space means that we can allocate a large logical address space,
and we do not need to allocate physical memory for unused sections
- also system libraries may be shared via mapping into virtual address space
** Demand Paging
- can bring entire process into memory at load time
- or bring page into memory only when needed
  - less i/o needed
  - less memory needed
  - faster response
- in general free pages are allocated from a pool
- lazy swapper :: only swaps a page into memory when page is needed
- pager :: swapper that deals with pages
- demand paging requires mmu functionality of valid-invalid bit
  - valid :: memory resident
  - invalid :: not in memory
- if valid-invalid bit is invalid during address translation, a *page fault* occurs
*** Page Fault
two cases:
- invalid reference -> abort
- just not in memory:
  1. find free frame
  2. swap page into frame
  3. reset tables to indicate page now in memory
    - set validation bit to valid
  4. restart the instruction that caused page fault
*** Pure demand paging
- start with no pages in memory
- OS sets instruction pointer to first instruction of process -> page fault
- a single instruction could access multiple pages, trigger multiple page faults
  - programs tend to have *locality of reference* so performance is not like this worst case
Hardware required for demand paging:
- page table with validation bit
- secondary memory (swap space)
- instruction restart
*** Performance of Demand Paging
- Three major activities in page-fault service time:
  - service the interrupt
  - read the page - majority of time
  - restart the process
*** Demand Paging Optimizations
- swap space i/o faster than file system i/o
  - swap allocated in larger chunks than file system
possible methods:
- copy entire process image to swap space at load time then page in and out
- demand page program binary from disk, but discard rather than page out when done
*** Copy-on-write
- allows both parent and child process to initially share the same pages in memory
- page only copied when modified (so only modified pages ever need to be copied)
** What if there are no free frames?
- page replacement :: find page in memory, but not in use. Page it out
  - what should the process do? terminate? swap out? replace the page?
Page replacement requires:
- modifying page-fault service routine to include page replacement
*** Basic page replacement
1. lookup address of desired page on disk
2. Find a free frame
   - if there is no free frame, use a page replacement algorithm to select a victim frame
   - write victim frame to disk if dirty
3. bring the desired page into the newly free frame, update page and frame table
4. continue process
*** page and frame replacement algorithms
- evaluate algorithm using reference string, containing list of page number to reference
some algorithms:
1. FIFO 
2. optimal (not actually possible, uses knowledge of future)
3. Least recently used
   - can be implemented using a counter associated with each page entry
   - can be implemented using a stack
     - updating after page reference is faster
     - but don't have to search through list for replacement
**** LRU Approximation Algorithm
- since lru implementations are expensive, it is easier to approximate
- special hardware is needed:
  - reference bit :: associated with each page, initially 0 set to 1 on page reference
- this results in *second-chance algorithm*
  - FIFO, but with reference bit
  - if page to be replaced has bit = 1, set to 0 then replace next page instead
- this can be further enhanced by also having a modify/dirty bit
- prioritize pages with both bits = 0
** Allocation of Frames
- two major allocation schemes:
  - fixed allocation
    - equal allocation
    - proportional allocation :: proportional to size of process
  - priority allocation
** replacement   
- global replacement :: process can take a frame from another frame as replacement
- local replacement :: process can only select from its own allocated frames
** Thrashing
- Many page faults leads to low CPU utilization 
- Operating system thinks it needs to increase degree of multiprogramming,
bring in more processes
- So each process has less pages, makes the problem worse.
- This leads to *Thrashing* :: when a process is busy swapping pages in and out
- Locality Model :: a set of pages actively used together.
- process migrates localities throughout execution/time
- if size of locality is greater than total memory size -> thrashing occurs
** Working-set Model
- working-set window = pages with a fixed number of page references
- use this to approximate locality, more importantly the size of the locality
** Allocating Kernel Memory
- often allocated from a free-memory pool
  - some kernel memory needs to be contiguous
*** Buddy System
- Allocates memory from fixed-size segment consisting of physically-contiguous pages
- memory allocated using power-of-2 allocator
  - requests fulfilled in units sized as power of 2
  - request rounded up to nearest power of 2
*** Slab Allocator
- Slab :: one or more physically contiguous pages
- Cache :: consists of one or more slabs
  - single cache for each unique kernel data structure
  - filled with empty data structure objects marked free
  - marked used when structure is stored
  - when slab is full, start using next empty slab, otherwise allocate new slab
** Other Considerations   
*** Prepaging
- to reduce page faults at start up, prepage some pages process will need
*** Page size
affects: 
- fragmentation
- page table size
- i/o overhead
- number of page faults
- etc.
*** TLB Reach
- TLB Reach = TLB Size * Page Size
*** Program Structure
* Chapter 10 
** Overview of Mass Storage Structure
- Magnetic disks using moving-head disk mechanism
- Has some transfer rate
- And some positioning time (random-access time) to move disk arm
  - includes seek time
  - and rotational latency
- Chance of *head crash* :: disk head making contact w/ disk surface
- results in bad sectors, systems to deal w/ this
- Drive attach to computer via I/O bus
  - host controller in computer uses bus to talk to disk controller in drive
** Hard Disk Performance
- Average latency = average access time = average seek time + average rotational latency
- Average I/O time = average access time + time to transfer + controller overhead
** Disk Structure
- disk address :: cylinder #, track #, sector #
- we can see it as large 1-dimensional array of logical blocks
- low-level formatting creates mapping of logical blocks to sequential sectors
- constant linear velocity (clv)
  - less sectors on inner track, more toward edge
  - drive increases rotation speed when head moves toward inner track to maintain data rate
- constant angular velocity 
  - disk rotates constantly
  - denser bits at inner tracks to keep the data rate constant
  - better deals w/ random access sense speed doesn't vary
** Disk Scheduling 
- we want to minimize seek time
- seek time ~= seek distance
*** Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
- selects the request w/ minimum seek time from the current head position.
- may cause starvation, is a form of SJF scheduling
*** SCAN
- the disk arm starts at one end of the disk and move towards the end then
  head is reversed and comes back. Servicing requests along the way
- sometimes called elevator algorithm
*** C-SCAN
- the head does not read while moving back to start
- slower, but shows less bias for values on middle of disk
*** Look and C-Look
- like SCAN, but don't move all the way to the edge of disk
- only go as far as most extreme address that needs to be read
** Selection A Disk-Scheduling Algorithm
- SSTF is a natural choice but has starvation possible
- Look algorithms are also good
** Disk Management
- Low-level formatting
  - divides a disk into sectors that the disk controller can r/w
  - each sector can hold header information, data, and error correction code
- to use a disk, the OS still needs to record its own data structures
  - partition
  - logical formatting (free and allocated spaces)
  - for increased efficiency most file system group blocks into *clusters*
** Bad Blocks 
- simple way: find bad blocks upon formatting or by command or when flagged
- replacement schemes:
  - sector sparing
  - sector slipping
** Swap-space Management
- usually in a separate raw partition
* Chapter 11
** File Attributes
- files contain a lot of metadata
** Open files
- Open-file table needed to track open files
  - file pointer
  - file-open count
  - disk location of the files 
  - access rights
** Open file locking
- Shared or exclusive locking
- mandatory or advisory lock
** Disk structure
* Chapter 12
** File System Implementation 
- Boot control block :: contains info needed to boot OS from volume
- Volume Control block :: contains volume details like # blocks, size of blocks, etc
  - also contains directory structure
- per file:
  - File Control Block ::
** Directory Implementation
- Linear list
  - B+ Tree
  - Linked List
- Hash Table
** Allocation Methods 
- Contiguous Allocation
  - Extent
- Linked Allocation :: like a linked list of blocks
  - reliability can be a problem, lost pointer causes loss of rest of file
*** File-Allocation Table (FAT) 
 - Beginning of volume has table, indexed by block number
 - Linked list, but faster on disk and cacheable
*** Indexed Allocation
- Each file has its own index block of pointers to its data blocks
- Like paging, what if all pointers can't fit in a single block?
  - multi-level index
** Free-space Management
- File system maintains free-space list
- Bitmap
- Linked List (free list)
